# House Prices Prediction Project
## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using various features of houses. The dataset used in this project is the train.csv file from the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques". The goal is to build a regression model to predict the sale price of houses based on their features. The project also includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation.

## Project Description
This project involves several key steps:

1.**Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
2.**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand relationships between features and the target variable.
3.**Model Building**: Creating a regression model using Linear Regression.
4.**Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using various metrics.
5.**Visualization**: Plotting various relationships and model predictions.

## Tools and Libraries

-**Python**: The programming language used for the project.
-**Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
-**NumPy**: For numerical operations.
-**Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
-**Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
-**Scikit-learn**: For machine learning, including data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains information on various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, and is used to predict the final sale price of homes and also be used to make different predications.

##Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing

-**Handling Missing Values**: Using forward fill to handle missing values.
-**Encoding Categorical Variables**: Using OneHotEncoder to convert categorical variables into a format that can be provided to ML algorithms.
-**Scaling Numerical Variables**: Using StandardScaler to standardize the features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-**Box Plot for LotArea vs. HouseStyle**: Visualizes the distribution of lot area across different house styles.
-**Line Plot for YrSold vs. YearBuilt**: Shows the relationship between the year sold and the year built.

### 3. Model Building
-**Linear Regression**: Creating a regression model to predict house prices.

### 4. Model Evaluation
-**Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) to evaluate the model.

### 5. Visualization
-**Actual vs Predicted Prices**: Scatter plot to visualize the performance of the model.
-**Additional Visualizations**: Box plots and line plots to explore relationships in the data
